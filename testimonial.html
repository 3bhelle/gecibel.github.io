        “Empowering Community ALS Implementers Through Digital Citizenship” is a program conducted by Information Technology (IT) Department in Northern Bukidnon State College. Digital Citizenship is considered an essential competency in today’s society. One has to have the necessary knowledge and skills to maximize opportunities that digital environments offer, while ensuring digital wellness and healthy interactions with others. This is to gain more knowledge on digital citizenry which can help ALS implementers on teaching Learning Strand 6-Digital Citizenship.
        It’s a great privilege that I am one of the attendees of this training. I have learned a lot since day 1, about the parts of a PC, spreadsheet, power point, creating web page and how to get the sum, average, min and max, round, the count and countA. This training is very helpful, it’s an application of modern technology to interact and share information among people all fields and develop science through technology. As an ALS implementer, I can develop material and the way of teaching to our ALS learners by elaborating the element of the subject in order that the material is easy received by our learners. This training helps my teaching learning process so easy.
        I ensure that these learnings must not stop in myself only, I would share these learnings to my ALS learners so that they will also learn. This lesson will help them so much because as what I have stated in the beginning of this reflection, Digital Citizenship is considered an essential competency in today’s society.
